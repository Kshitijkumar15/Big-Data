1) Creates a directory named path in HDFS
hdfs dfs -mkdir <path>
hdfs dfs -mlkdir /home


2) Copies the file or directory from the local file system identified by localSrc to dest within the DFS
hdfs dfs -put <localSrc> <dest>
hdfs dfs -put (paste location of local file) /home


3) Lists the contents of the directory specified by path, showing the names, permissions, owner, size and modification date for each entry.
hdfs dfs -ls <path>
hdfs dfs -ls /Titanicdata


4) Behaves like -ls, but recursively displays entries in all subdirectories of path.
hdfs dfs -lsr <path>
hdfs dfs -lsr /


5) Displays the contents of filename on stdout.
hdfs dfs -cat <file-name>
hdfs dfs -cat /sh.txt


6) Moves the file or directory indicated by src to dest, within HDFS.
hdfs dfs -mv <src> <dest>
hdfs dfs -mv /Crime.csv /home/

7) Copies the file or directory identified by src to dest, within HDFS.
 hdfs dfs -cp <src> <dest>
hdfs dfs -cp /data.txt /home/data/


8) Removes the file or empty directory identified by path.
hdfs dfs -rm <path>
hdfs dfs -rm /data.txt


9) Removes the file or directory identified by path. Recursively deletes any child entries
hdfs dfs -rmr <path>
hdfs dfs -rmr /home/


10) Identical to -put (copy file)
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal <localSrc> <dest>
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal file:///home/hadoop/sh.txt /home/


11) Copies the file or directory from the local file system identified by localSrc to dest within HDFS, and then deletes the local copy on success.
hdfs dfs -moveFromLocal <localSrc> <dest>

12) Copies the file or directory in HDFS identified by src to the local file system path identified by localDest.
hdfs dfs -get [-crc] <src> <localDest>
hdfs dfs -get /process-bank-data /home/hadoop
